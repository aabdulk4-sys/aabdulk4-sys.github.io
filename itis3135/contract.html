    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, Ayah Abdulkareem, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
      Spring 2025, ITIS3135, Web Design & Development class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
      and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
      As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure 
      and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
      I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly 
      given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Signed:</strong> Ayah Abdulkareem, 08/30/2025</p>
